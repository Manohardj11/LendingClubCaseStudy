# Lending Club Case Study

## Goals of data analysis:  

``` 
Lending club is the largest peer-to-peer marketplace connecting borrowers with lenders. Borrowers apply 
through an online platform where they are assigned an internal score. Lenders decide 
-whether to lend 
-And the terms of loan such as interest rate, monthly instalment, tenure etc

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company 

The main objective is to be able to identify these loan applicants who are more likely to become default,then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
